###### Harnessing and quantifying textual data has become especially relevant in the world of finance as text-based data is used to complement typical financial variables.
###### In this project I have tried to identify the topics being mentioned in sustainability reports published by various companies in the financial services, textile and apparel industry etc. Through this approach, I have tried to establish a quantitative technique to assess greenwashing i.e window dressing by studying the language used in the text. And by examining the use of boiler-plate content.
